<p title="about nagham life">Hello, my name is Nagham, I am 19 years old, and I was born on 7/19/2004. I am the second sister in my family. I am in my third year at university studying computer engineering in Khadouri. I live in Tulkarm. I traveled as a child and studied in the United Arab Emirates at the end of 2015. I came and lived here in Palestine, Tulkarm. Until now, I am still here in Tulkarm. I graduated with a grade of 96.6 and decided to study. In the field of computers, I aspire to develop myself in programming more and more, so I have currently registered for the Full Stack Round 10 course. I hope to work and support myself in the future.</p>
